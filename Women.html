		<p>Violence against women is a prevalent crime throughout the world; 
		however, the information that is available throughout the Middle East is limited. 
		The issue of intimate partner violence throughout the region is very common, 
		and if not addressed, it can lead to a silent but deadly epidemic. The various forms 
		of violence against women can be attributed to the specific cultural, social, and economic 
		environments of different countries. Women consistently face systematic discrimination 
		in which they have few resources to turn to.</p>

		<p>Throughout the Middle East, it is estimated that over 37% of women have 
		experienced domestic violence, which is a shockingly large percent that must be 
		reduced (The Globalist). In these countries, domestic violence should be treated 
		through a public health approach and reduce the chance that women cope with mental health 
		issues and substance abuse. Domestic violence can also increase the chance of sexually 
		transmitted diseases and lead to infertility and more serious issues. In addition, throughout 
		the cases of domestic violence in the Middle East, over 80% of the abusers are from the immediate
		family, meaning a woman’s father or elder brother (The Globalist).</p>

		<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic violence has been on the rise since curfews are
		common to reduce the transmission of the disease. Their abusers that once went to work are
		now staying at home, which continues the cycle of abuse towards their wife. One anonymous
		woman living in the Middle East remarked that physical abuse had become so familiar to her 
		that it was like the “air I breathe. I know nothing else” (Shahatit). Women have that have 
		been subjected to consistent abuse may find themselves returning back to their homes due to 
		public scandal or fear for their children. The creation of highly stressful situations every
		day creates an environment of fear and has detrimental effects for women that must risk domestic
		abuse if they do not comply with their husband’s wishes.</p>
		
		<p>There has been a push in recent years to combat the breach of human rights that women face.
		It is our hope to provide the resources for women of all ages that are enduring domestic violence 
		to find support and strength to assist them in their journey of escaping an abusive environment.</p>
